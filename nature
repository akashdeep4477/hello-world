No matter what is going on in your career, good advice is universal. No matter what problems you are trying to solve, chances are someone else before you had a similar problem.

I've been a journalist for the better part of two decades and during that time I've interviewed and written about thousands of people in various stages of success, from billionaires to entrepreneurs launching startups (one while fighting brain cancer).

All of that has led me to conclude that there are certain universal "business truths" - tips and tricks that work for nearly everyone in every business. They are:

    Have a passion for your work. If your work is meaningful to you, your work life will be a joy.
    If you can't be passionate about the work itself, be passionate about the reason you do it. Maybe you don't love your job/company/career, but the money and benefits are good for your family. Be passionate in your choice to do right by your family.
    If something needs changing, be the one to lead the change. If you dislike your job but are stuck, work on getting the skills that will get you unstuck. If there's a problem at your office, work on being the one solve it.
